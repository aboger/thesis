  Abstract                 = {Android is a widely anticipated open source operating system for mobile devices that provides a basic operating system, an application middleware layer, a Java software development kit (SDK), and a collection of system applications. Since the source code of Android was released to people, a large community of developers has organized around Android. This paper studies the open source project of FFmpeg and implements a file decoder. Then discusses the Android media player framework and reports the decoder libs to Android. At last, designs and implement an application.},

Several aspects of protocol functionality are covered. We have tried to focus on those aspects that are most important for successful operation of VoIP networks, ranging from characteristics of syntax to functions of infrastructure elements and support for third party call control and other communications applications. Security features and some implementation issues are analyzed as well. Conclusion is that although H.323 appeared earlier, SIP is better adapted to the Internet environment which is the most important reason for its success. Also greater standardization activity related to applications of SIP (e.g. presence services, instant messaging) made it more attractive to developers.},

  Abstract                 = {APIs are one of the most important concepts in today's modern software engineering. They allow software developers to work independently and minimize the impact caused by changes in the implementation of software services. Despite their importance, currently there are only a few approaches that guide the design of an API. In this paper, we present an approach, and associated tool, that allows an API client (developer) to evaluate the usability of an API and decide whether to use it (release it). In this aspect, our approach goes beyond previous approaches by performing this complexity and usability API analysis automatically.},
